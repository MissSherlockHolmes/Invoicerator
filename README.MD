## Project Description

Invoicerator is a web application that allows users to create and send custom PDF invoice forms with ease. The application focuses on privacy by deleting forms immediately after they are sent. Users can also upload previously generated PDF forms to auto-populate fields and edit them again.

## Most Likely Tech Stack

- **Back-end**: Go (Gin framework) OR Python (Flask framework)
- **Front-end**: ReactJS 18, Bootstrap/Tailwind
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or SQLite (for user account storage)

## Main Milestones

1. **Project Setup and Environment Configuration**: Setting up repositories, basic environment configuration for both back-end and front-end, database initialization, and basic routing.
2. **User Authentication and Database Integration**: Implement user registration, login functionality, and integration with SQLite for account management.
3. **Form Builder Development**: Build the form creation interface, including the ability to add text fields, checkboxes, and other form elements.
4. **PDF Generation and Management**: Implement the functionality to generate and send PDFs and delete them immediately after they are sent.
5. **PDF Upload and Re-editing**: Develop the feature allowing users to upload old PDF forms, auto-populate fields, and edit them.
